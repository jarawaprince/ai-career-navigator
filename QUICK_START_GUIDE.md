# üöÄ Quick Start: Implementing the New UI

## ‚ö° 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Copy New Components

```bash
# Copy all the new component files to your project
cp OnboardingFlow.jsx /your-project/client/src/components/
cp ChatInterface.jsx /your-project/client/src/components/
cp RoadmapView.jsx /your-project/client/src/components/
cp SkillGapChart.jsx /your-project/client/src/components/
cp RoadmapTimeline.jsx /your-project/client/src/components/
cp CourseCard.jsx /your-project/client/src/components/
cp SalaryInsights.jsx /your-project/client/src/components/
cp App.jsx /your-project/client/src/
```

### Step 2: Update Backend API Endpoint

Add this to your `/server/index.js`:

```javascript
app.post("/api/chat", async (req, res) => {
  const { message, userProfile, conversationHistory } = req.body;

  try {
    // Your LangChain processing here
    // Use userProfile for personalization
    const response = await yourLangChainFunction(message, userProfile);

    // Check if user is ready for roadmap
    const roadmapKeywords = ["generate", "roadmap", "show me", "create plan"];
    const wantsRoadmap = roadmapKeywords.some((kw) =>
      message.toLowerCase().includes(kw)
    );

    if (wantsRoadmap) {
      const roadmap = await generateRoadmap(userProfile, conversationHistory);
      return res.json({
        response: "Here's your personalized career roadmap!",
        roadmapReady: true,
        roadmap: roadmap,
      });
    }

    res.json({
      response: response,
      roadmapReady: false,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```

### Step 3: Create Sample Roadmap Generator

Add this function to generate structured roadmap data:

```javascript
async function generateRoadmap(userProfile, conversationHistory) {
  // This is a sample structure - replace with your LangChain/RAG logic
  return {
    skillGap: {
      currentSkills: [
        { name: "Communication", level: "Advanced" },
        { name: "Content Creation", level: "Advanced" },
        // ... from your analysis
      ],
      skillsNeeded: [
        {
          name: "Data Analysis",

    },
  };
}
```

### Step 4: Test the Flow

1. Start your server: `npm run dev` (in server folder)
2. Start your client: `npm run dev` (in client folder)
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
4. Complete the onboarding
5. Chat with AI
6. Generate roadmap
7. Explore all 6 tabs

## üéØ Key Integration Points

### 1. Onboarding Data Flow

```javascript
OnboardingFlow ‚Üí userProfile ‚Üí ChatInterface ‚Üí Backend
```

### 2. Chat to Roadmap Flow

```javascript
User message ‚Üí Backend analysis ‚Üí Roadmap generation ‚Üí RoadmapView
```

### 3. Data Structure to Pass

```javascript
{
  userProfile: {
    currentRole: string,
    experience: string,
    dreamJob: string,
    timeCommitment: string,
    location: string,
    background: string
  },
  message: string,
  conversationHistory: Array<{role, content}>
}
```

## üîß Customization Points

### Colors (Tailwind CSS)

- Change in each component's className props
- Or modify `tailwind.config.js`

### Content

- Modify onboarding questions in `OnboardingFlow.jsx`
- Change quick actions in `ChatInterface.jsx`
- Update info cards text

### Backend Logic

- Replace sample `generateRoadmap()` with your RAG
- Use HNSWLib vector search for courses
- Parse CSV files for salary data

## üìä Required Data Files

Make sure your `/server/data/` has:

- `job_descriptions.csv` - For skill extraction
- `course_catalog.csv` - For recommendations
- `salary_data.csv` - For salary insights
- `skills_database.json` - For skill matching

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

### Issue: "Cannot find module"

**Fix:** Make sure all imports match your file structure

### Issue: API not responding

**Fix:** Check CORS settings and port numbers

### Issue: Roadmap not displaying

**Fix:** Console.log the roadmap data to verify structure

### Issue: Tailwind classes not working

**Fix:** Ensure Tailwind is properly configured

## üéâ Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

- ‚úÖ Onboarding collects all user data
- ‚úÖ Chat shows profile summary card
- ‚úÖ AI responds with context-aware messages
- ‚úÖ Roadmap generates and displays all tabs
- ‚úÖ All visualizations render correctly
- ‚úÖ Navigation between stages works smoothly

## üìö Next Steps After Implementation

1. **Add Real Data:** Connect to actual Australian job boards
2. **Implement RAG:** Use LangChain to search your vector store
3. **Add Auth:** Let users save their roadmaps
4. **Enable Sharing:** Generate shareable links
5. **Add PDF Export:** Let users download their plans
6. **Track Progress:** Let users mark tasks complete
7. **Add Reminders:** Email/SMS for milestones

## üí° Pro Tips

1. Start with **sample data** to test the UI
2. **Validate** the user experience before backend integration
3. Use **console.log** liberally during development
4. Test on **mobile** early and often
5. Get **real user feedback** before over-engineering
