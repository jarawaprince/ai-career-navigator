## 🔧 **Backend Integration Required**

You'll need to update your backend to:

1. **Accept user profile data:**

```javascript
{
  currentRole: string,
  experience: string,
  dreamJob: string,
  timeCommitment: string,
  location: string,
  background: string
}
```

2. **Return structured roadmap data:**

```javascript
{
  skillGap: { ... },
  timeline: { months: [...] },
  courses: [...],
  salary: { ... },
  jobSearch: { ... },
  uniqueAngle: { ... }
}
```

3. **Detect when to generate roadmap:**

- Listen for keywords: "generate", "roadmap", "show me"
- Return `{ roadmapReady: true, roadmap: {...} }`

See **QUICK_START_GUIDE.md** for complete backend examples.
